The dam, located on the Mayurakshi River, is a popular spot known for its scenic beauty and was the perfect destination for a day filled with fun and learning. The aim of the picnic was to provide a relaxing experience in nature while fostering camaraderie among students and teachers.Activities included a guided tour of the dam, where students learned about its history, purpose, and engineering significance. Teachers explained how the dam helps in irrigation and power generation, making it a valuable resource for the region. The tour was both educational and inspirational, providing insights into the importance of water conservation and natural resource management.Around noon, everyone gathered near the banks of the river to enjoy a delicious lunch prepared by the schoolâ€™s staff. After lunch, students had some leisure time to enjoy games and activities organized by the teachers. Popular activities included tug-of-war, sack races, and musical chairs. Many students also spent time by the river, enjoying the fresh air and the gentle sound of flowing water.The school picnic to Massanjore Dam was a memorable experience filled with laughter, learning, and unforgettable moments. The trip provided a refreshing break from the usual school routine and allowed students and teachers to bond in a relaxed setting. The students returned with a renewed appreciation for nature and a better understanding of the importance of natural resources.The picnic to Massanjore Dam will always be remembered as a day of joy, knowledge, and unity."
